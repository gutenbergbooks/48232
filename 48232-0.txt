
Greetings!

We have long specialized in the manufacture of Time and Labor Saving
Account Books, Grain Tables and Cipher Codes for Grain Dealers. We strive
to incorporate the most practical suggestions of the trade as to form and
arrangement, and to make each book all that could be desired in workmanship
and quality of materials used. Suggestions for their improvement will be
welcome.

Each order encourages us to give more time and thought to the wants of
grain dealers. When in need write

The changes in Grades of Grain, new Railroads and Freight Lines, and
advanced methods of doing business has made it necessary to insert new
cipher words and phrases in "THE ROBINSON TELEGRAPHIC CIPHER."

The "Revised Edition" retains all the cipher words and phrases of former
editions, in identically the same relationship, the only difference being
_additions_, which are all _printed in Italics_, that you may easily
distinguish and only use them with correspondents who have the "Revised
Edition."

Additions will be found on the following pages: 2, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 49,
49_a_, 78, 79, 80, 81, 85, 86, 87, 88, 92 and 103.

The same care has been exercised in the selection of safe "cipher" or code
words, not easily misread from copy or changed in telegraphic transmission,
that has helped largely to make "THE ROBINSON CIPHER" the accepted standard
code for the Trade.

The cipher words for the new phrases follow as closely in alphabetical
order as possible without changing the position of the old ones.

Where blanks occur in or at the terminus of the printed phrases let the
cipher word or words supplying such blanks follow the cipher word of the
phrase in respective order, as "Revelation, Alkali, Chicago," for "Quote
price No. 2 corn laid down in Chicago."

When the price is manifestly above 1.10 the _dollar_ will be understood and
not expressed, as "Churl," for 1.35¼.

SUPPLEMENT

Telegraphic Cipher.

EXPLANATORY.


In adding a Supplement to THE ROBINSON TELEGRAPHIC CIPHER, no other change
whatever has been made.

All but the supplement being printed from the same plates as the former
Revised Edition.

The supplement will supply to a great extent phrases, etc., that changes in
business methods and new Grades, Railroads, etc., have been called into use
since the last revision.

The additions by themselves, rather than scattered through the code, will
avoid danger of using a code word for the additions, with one who has not
as yet received a copy with the supplement.

With the present arrangement it will at times be necessary to look in two
places, for a phrase or code word, the extra turn of a leaf.

Many users of the code having written their own phrases on the blank lines,
or pasted phrases over the printed ones they do not care for, but using the
"Code" word for the phrase covered up. Any change in the original book
would cause confusion, loss and lack of confidence.

You have probably found phrases not needed by you, and failed to find some
you do want; to supply this need, write them in the blank lines. A few
minutes time will do it.

To attempt to put in one Code the matter to meet all wants, _the size would
kill its usefulness_.

Time is too valuable these days of rush, to use a dollar's worth hunting
through a big code to save a few cents in Telegraph Tolls.

Better use two code words, combining the phrases of each, for even then you
will seldom fail to get your Telegram inside ten words.


THE ALL IMPORTANT THING IS SAFETY.

Very few realize the liability of error by the receiving operator in
receiving cipher or code words by sound, where the connecting words are no
help.

The missing or adding of a single dot or dash, the misjudgment of a
"space", may change the entire meaning.

It is therefore _vital_ that the code words should be selected with the
utmost care, and by one fully competent to judge of their fitness.

I studied nearly a year selecting a list of words I considered safe to use,
analyzing every one from a telegraphic standpoint, as well as from their
liability of being _misread_ from manuscript. In many cases several words
equally safe, if but one used. Cutting out the words from Webster's
Unabridged Dictionary till I had between five and six thousand I considered
safe to use as "code words."

Every word added, the danger of error increases, and the more words added
the ratio of danger increasing in proportion.

In this selection I gave the benefit of fifteen years' personal experience
as an operator and manager, over three years as operator and cipher clerk
for the United States Government, and ten of the fifteen as telegraph
manager on the Chicago Board of Trade.

In the majority of codes the cipher words are virtually copied as they come
out of a dictionary. Many words so little in use that the sending operator
for fear of sending one wrong asks to have the words rewritten, thus
causing delay that may cost as much as _if sent wrong_.

During the past thirty-five years THE ROBINSON TELEGRAPHIC CIPHER has been,
and is still in use in nearly every city and town in the United States and
Canada having a telegraph office. Thousands using it, yet the errors in
transmitting its code words are less even than in messages in plain
English. In fact virtually _nil_.

Its record speaks for itself.
